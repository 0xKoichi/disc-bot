## About The Project

A pretty typical run-of-the-mill Discord bot using the discord.js library alongside the addition of the discordjs/builders package for seamless Slash Command generation. Everything is coded from scratch without the use of other discord-related packages, just for the sheer experience of practicing asynchronous programming with JavaScript and following the functional paradigm.

Points of interest:

* Contains the beta 'activities' feature â€“ some of the application ids utilised were found by calling Discord's API. They are pretty buggy features so I would not recommend implementing them into your bot.
* Economy is upheld upon MongoDB just for testing purposes, Redis will most likely be incorporated at some stage.
* The Node.js is ran and hosted on Heroku with a pipeline connected to this Git, feel free to make any PRs and they will be examined.

## Built With

Node, Discord.js, MongoDB.
